# Arduino-Servo-Class

Dependencies:
Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library
(Use the Library Manager in Arduino to install the Adafruit pwm servo driver library)

This code is used for controlling the Servo Pumpkin with multiple routines. This code can also be applied to other projects that use the PCA9685 PWM controller with an Arduino to control servos  
  
Python version for the Raspberry Pi: https://github.com/pythoncader/RaspberryPi-Python-PCA9685  
The original code to control the pumpkin (with Arduino) can also be found here: https://github.com/pythoncader/ServoPumpkin
